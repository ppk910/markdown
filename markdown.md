A paragraph (from Ancient Greek παράγραφος (parágraphos) 'to write beside')  
is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.  
Though not required by the orthographic conventions of any language with a writing system, paragraphs are a conventional means of organizing extended segments of prose.

If you’d like to know more about these Markdown implementations, you’re welcome to explore any number of other Markdown apps and tutorials. Here are just a few:
